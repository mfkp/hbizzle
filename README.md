<p><strong>The problem:</strong> A certain online media streaming service, which we will affectionately call human body oder, has an awful user experience.  It stinks.  It's hard enough to find movies at all, let alone good movies.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> Hbizzle.</p>
<p>Hbizzle is a learning system.  Aggregating all the critical scores of each film from human body oder, the hbizzle score is a combination of these scores and <em>soon</em> a weighted representation of total plays derived from hbizzle.com.  That means, that if you use Hbizzle as an interface to human body odor, it's going to learn from you, and recommend you better movies over time.  Pretty sweet, right?</p>
